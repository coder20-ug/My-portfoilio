      <h2>The Birth of Spider-Man</h2>
      <p>
        Peter Parker, a brilliant but shy teenager from Queens, New York, lived a normal life with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May. Gifted in science, Peter often faced bullying and rejection. One day, during a field trip to a science lab, Peter was bitten by a genetically modified spider.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bite granted him extraordinary powers‚Äîsuperhuman strength, enhanced agility, spider-like reflexes, and the ability to cling to walls. Initially using his powers for personal gain, Peter failed to stop a robber who later killed his beloved Uncle Ben.
      </p>

      <h2>With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility</h2>
      <p>
        That moment defined Peter‚Äôs life. Realizing his mistake, he vowed to use his abilities to protect others. Creating a red-and-blue suit and designing web-shooters from his scientific knowledge, Peter became the masked vigilante known as Spider-Man.
      </p>
      <p>
        Balancing school, work, and his secret identity, Peter fought against powerful enemies‚ÄîGreen Goblin, Doctor Octopus, Venom, and more‚Äîeach battle shaping his sense of duty and sacrifice.
      </p>

      <h2>The Symbol of Hope</h2>
      <p>
        Over time, Spider-Man grew into a symbol of hope for New York City. He inspired others in the Spider-Verse and even joined legendary teams like the Avengers. Despite personal loss, Peter Parker remained true to his mission‚Äîto stand for justice, no matter the cost.
